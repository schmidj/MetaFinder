Abstract There is growing concern that recreational
shoreline angling activity may negatively impact littoral
and riparian habitats independent of any direct or indirect
influences of fish harvest or fishing mortality through
mechanisms such as disturbance (e.g., trampling, erosion)
and pollution (e.g., littering). We sampled a suite of aquatic
and terrestrial variables (i.e., water quality, aquatic and
terrestrial macrophytes, soil compaction, anthropogenic
refuse) at 14 high shoreline angling-activity sites (identi-
fied by way of interviews with conservation officers and
angling clubs) within an urban area (Ottawa, Canada). For
each high angling-activity site, a nearby corresponding low
angling-activity site was sampled for comparison. We
found that the percentage of barren area and soil compac-
tion were greater in areas of high angling activity compared
with areas that experienced relatively low angling activity.
In addition, terrestrial and aquatic macrophyte density,
height, and diversity were lower at high angling-activity
sites. Angling- and non-angling-related litter was present in
large quantities at each of the high angling-activity sites,
and comparatively little litter was found at low angling-
activity sites. Collectively, these findings indicate that
shoreline angling does alter the riparian environment,
contributing to pollution and environmental degradation in
areas of high angling intensity. With growing interest in
providing urban angling opportunities and in response to
increasing interest in developing protected areas and parks,
a better understanding of the ecologic impacts of shoreline
angling is necessary to address multiuser conflicts, to
develop angler outreach and educational materials, and to
optimize management of angling effort to maintain eco-
logic integrity of riparian and aquatic ecosystems.

Introduction
Globally, there is increasing evidence that recreational
angling is contributing to decreased aquatic ecosystem
health (Cooke and Cowx 2006). Although recreational
fishing may be considered a relatively low-impact activity in
terms of environmental degradation, the potential impacts of
angling are often underestimated (Post and others 2002;
Cooke and Cowx 2004, 2006; Lewin and others 2006).
Participation rates vary extensively throughout the world
(Arlinghaus and Cooke 2008); however, overall global
estimates suggest that as many as 727 million anglers par-
ticipate in recreational fishing annually (Cooke and Cowx
2004). In Canada alone, [3.2 million people engage in
angling activities each year (Department of Fisheries and
Oceans Canada 2007). In the United States, this number is
closer to 34 million (United States Fish and Wildlife Service
2001). With the bulk of human populations focused in urban
centres, participation in urban recreational fishing activities
is often high, and these recreational fisheries provide
important social and economic benefits because many cities
offer convenient access to shoreline fishing sites where
anglers of all ages and ability levels may participate in

recreational fishing activities (Fedler and Ditton 1994;
Schramm and Edwards 1994). Because of the potential
cumulative effects associated with recreational angling,
there is cause for concern in terms of conservation and
maintenance of aquatic and adjacent terrestrial (e.g.,
shorelines, coasts, riparian areas) ecosystems.
To date, much work on the effects of recreational
angling has focused on interactions between the angler and
the individual fish that are targeted or captured either
intentionally or as by-catch, including those that are har-
vested as well as those caught and released. More than 200
studies have focused on the injury, stress, and mortality
associated with angling and releasing fish relative to factors
such as gear type, environmental conditions, and angler
behaviour (reviewed in Arlinghaus and others 2007).
Clearly, harvest can result in fishery declines because this
is increasingly being observed in coastal and inland rec-
reational fisheries (Post and others 2002; Coleman and
others 2004). However, many of these fish are released
(global estimates suggest release rates of 60% [Cooke and
Cowx 2004]); thus, unintentional mortality may result. In
addition, fishery-induced selectivity may influence size and
age structure of fish populations, genetic variability, evo-
lutionary changes, and ecosystem trophic cascades (Lewin
and others 2006).
However, like the commercial fishing sector (Dayton
and others 2005), broader environmental impacts are
associated with recreational fishing in freshwater systems
that extend beyond impacts on individual fish or fish
populations as a direct result of harvest or fishing mortality.
For example, anthropogenic debris along shorelines and in
adjacent water bodies have a negative impact on the local
environment (Cryer and others 1987; Radomski and others
2006). Loss of fishing gear (e.g., line, lures, hooks, lead
weights) along shorelines can affect both the substrate in
which it is deposited as well as wildlife present in the area
(Forbes 1986; Cryer and others 1987; Lewin and others
2006; Radomski and others 2006). Lead has a slow dis-
solution rate and a high stability in sediment, leading to
ingestion by waterfowl, which subsequently may suffer the
effects of lead poisoning (Cryer and others 1987; Scheu-
hammer and others 2003). In addition, waterfowl have also
been shown to become entangled in discarded fishing line
(Cryer and others 1987; Franson and others 2003).
Areas that experience high fishing effort may also be
subjected to considerable shoreline changes because of
general human activity, which can lead to a cascade of
deleterious changes in both the terrestrial and aquatic
environments. Increased foot traffic into angling access
points could potentially lead to removal of vegetation (Cole
1987; Marion and Cole 1996; Mu¨ller and others 2003), loss
of plant diversity (Cole 1987; Ros and others 2004), soil
compaction (Marion and Cole 1996; Roovers and others
2004; Andre´s-Abella´n and others 2005), and erosion, fac-
tors that have rarely been studied in the context of recre-
ational fishing (Cooke and Cowx 2006; Lewin and others
2006) but are known in terms of hiking and camping
impacts (reviewed in Sun and Walsh 1998). In turn,
because riparian vegetation is important in providing
overhead cover and shade for fish and also in anchoring
soil, riparian disturbance may lead to increased shoreline
erosion as well as decreased habitat complexity (Delong
and Brusven 1991; Schiemer and others 1995; Schindler
and Scheuerell 2002). Soil compaction increases bulk
density and decreases soil porosity (Lei 2004), further
contributing to erosion processes, surface runoff into
nearby watersheds, and water-quality degradation (Koz-
lowski 1999). Subsequently, poor water quality can have
detrimental effects on the health, distribution, and abun-
dance of aquatic flora and fauna (Miner and Stein 1996).
Highly turbid water can decrease sunlight penetration into
the water column, restricting submergent plant growth,
obstructing fish gills (Sutherland and Meyer 2008), and
affecting predator–prey interactions (Miner and Stein
1996). Dissolved oxygen is a major limiting factor for fish,
with low levels having significant physiologic effects
(Kramer 1987; Kruk 2007). With the removal of shoreline
vegetation at angling access points, shade in nearshore
areas may be decreased, thus increasing water temperatures
while locally decreasing dissolved oxygen levels. The
ultimate impacts of recreational angling activity on the
abiotic environment may lead to short- and long-term
impacts on fish populations and aquatic ecosystems
because of changes in the structure and condition of these
systems (Lewin and others 2006) as well as to the broader
interconnected terrestrial-aquatic system.
In marine systems, protected areas and zoning are being
used to regulate human use and activities. However, similar
efforts have not been widely used in freshwater systems
(Suski and Cooke 2007), although some aquatic areas are
protected by being contained within terrestrial protected
areas. At present, however, there is insufficient information
on the ecologic and environmental consequences of
shoreline angling to optimize the management of angling
effort to maintain the ecologic integrity of riparian and
aquatic ecosystems. With growing emphasis on creating
recreational fishing opportunities in or near urban centres,
there is a need for information on the potential environ-
mental consequences of recreational fishing to ensure that
the ecologic integrity of riparian systems is maintained.
Hence, the objective of this study was to evaluate links
between shoreline angling and changes in aquatic and
shoreline systems to determine the potential ecologic
impacts of shoreline angling in and near a major urban
centre in North America. We predicted that areas experi-
encing high frequencies of angling activity might be

subject to increased levels of ecologic degradation com-
pared with areas not exposed to the same degree of
anthropogenic disturbance. We expected to see decreases
in water quality, evidence of anthropogenic waste,
decreased riparian vegetative cover (resulting in greater
barren area and soil compaction), and lower fish diversity
in such areas.
Methods
Study Site
Between July 16 and 27, 2007, we sampled a set of 14
shoreline angling-activity sites and 14 corresponding low
angling-activity sites (28 sites in total) in the Ottawa,
Ontario, and Gatineau, Quebec, regions of Canada. The
greater Ottawa-Gatineau metropolitan area has a population
[1.3 million people, and 20% of urban land use in the
region is devoted to parks and green space (City of Ottawa
Census Data 2006). The Ottawa-Gatineau region has a
number of warm-water lakes and large rivers, most of which
are dominated by fish from the family Centrarchidae.
Centrarchids (including smallmouth bass [Micropterus
dolomieu], largemouth bass [Micropterus salmoides],
pumpkinseed [Lepomis gibbosus], bluegill Lepomis mac-
rochirus], and black crappie [Pomoxis nigromaculatus]) as
well as other members of the local fish fauna (including
common carp [Cyprinus carpio], channel catfish [Ictalurus
punctatus], northern pike [Esox lucius], muskellunge Esox
masquinongy], and walleye [Sander vitreus]) can be easily
angled from shore. Local municipalities as well as the pro-
vincial fish and wildlife agency (i.e., the Ontario Ministry of
Natural Resources) have developed maps and fishing guides
specifically intended to facilitate shoreline angling in and
around this urban area. Because the goal of the study was to
evaluate the impacts of shoreline fishing activity, it was
necessary to identify locales where this activity was com-
mon. It is also important to recognize that virtually all
shorelines are somewhat accessible to anglers; however,
there is clearly a range of fishing activity across locations.
Initially, a local conservation officer and local anglers
were consulted to gain information about locations of
popular shoreline angling locations. Subsequently, each
site was visited to determine suitability for inclusion in the
study (i.e., to evaluate whether there were signs of angler
use). Sites with recent evidence of shoreline angling (bar-
ren and compacted soil, trampled vegetation, presence of
fishing-related debris, etc.) were designated as treatment
sites and eventually sampled. Sites with artificially hard-
ened shorelines, docks, and cement wall structures were
avoided because of the impossibility of measuring some
variables (e.g., soil compaction, vegetation, etc.) at these
locales. Furthermore, site selection was focused at loca-
tions where there was minimal evidence of other human
use (e.g., dog walking, canoe launching), which would
confound the study. However, it is important to note that
for both high angling- and low angling-activity sites, it is
possible that other human use occurs. For comparison, a
low angling-activity site (control) was selected 25 m away
from each high angling-activity site (direction along the
shoreline in relation to the high angling-activity site was
determined randomly). The low angling-activity sites were
relatively undisturbed compared with the associated high
angling-activity sites, and no anglers were noted at these
locations. In total, 14 pairs of high angling activity-sites
and associated control sites were sampled (7 located on the
Rideau River, 6 on the Ottawa River, and 1 on Dow’s
Lake). The majority of the sites sampled were lotic sys-
tems; however, water velocities at these sites were low
enough to be considered comparable with the more lentic
sites sampled.
Data Collection
At each site, both aquatic and terrestrial sampling was
conducted to detect differences in five suites of variables
corresponding to water quality, soil compaction, discarded
litter, macrophyte density and abundance, and fish com-
munity. In high angling-activity areas, onshore sampling
was centred at the area that would most likely be where an
angler would stand while fishing. To quantify the close
range and immediate effects of angling activity, such as
soil compaction and discarded litter, a 0.25-m 2 quadrat was
placed at the location where an angler would most likely
position his or her feet while fishing (the ‘‘angler stand’’).
A soil sample was taken from the centre of the angler stand
using a 100-cm3 soil corer. Each soil sample was preserved
in an airtight bag, later dried in an oven for 42 h at 85°C,
and then weighed to the closest tenth of a gram to deter-
mine bulk density (cm 3 /g). In addition, we noted the per-
centage of barren area as well as the number of species and
height of the four tallest plants of onshore plants found
within the quadrat. A second, larger onshore 6-m 2 quadrat
was set up to quantify the effects of angling within the area
in which a typical fishing rod would reach. Percentage of
barren area, number of plant species, and the height of the
four tallest plants were measured within the 6-m 2 quadrat.
We collected litter (both angling-specific [e.g., lure pack-
aging, worm containers] and non-angling-specific [e.g.,
pop cans, cigarette butts]) within the 6-m 2 quadrat as well
as the 0.25-m 2 quadrat. The weight of each piece of litter
was determined to the closest tenth of a gram, and
the lengths of fishing line fragments were measured to
the nearest centimetre. Low angling-activity sites were
sampled in the same manner, although the 0.25-m 2 quadrat
326 Environmental Management (2009) 44:324–334
123
was randomly placed rather than centred on an area of
angler activity.
Aquatic sampling was conducted at three distances (0, 5,
and 10 m from the water’s edge) perpendicular to the
shore, in line with the designated angler standing position.
At each sampling distance, a 0.25-m 2 quadrat was placed
on the bottom to measure variables at those immediate
locations. First, a water sample was obtained from each site
to determine turbidity values (in nephelometric turbidity
units [NTU]) using a turbidity meter (LaMotte model 2020,
Chesterton, MD). Water temperature (°C) and dissolved
oxygen (mg/L) readings were taken at each of the three
distances from shore at a depth of 30 cm below the water’s
surface using a handheld meter (YSI Model 85 Handheld
Oxygen, Conductivity, Salinity, and Temperature System,
Yellow Springs, OH). Within the 0.25-m 2 quadrat (at each
site), a snorkeler measured depth, distance to the closest
cover (from the centre of the quadrat), and type of cover.
The types of cover included in the study were any in-water
structure that fish could use for foraging activities and
predator avoidance (e.g., aquatic macrophyte beds, boul-
ders, large woody debris). Within the quadrat, macrophyte
density, height of the four tallest individual macrophytes,
and number of species (species richness) were quantified.
Angling- and non-angling-specific litter was collected and
processed in the same manner as previously described at
each of the three 0.25-m 2 quadrats. Finally, shortly after
sampling (so as to mitigate disturbances associated with
sampling), a fish community survey of number of species
and number of individuals was performed by the snorkeler
(Dolloff and others 1996) within a 10 9 10-m quadrat
extending out into the water, centred on the onshore angler
standing position. The survey was completed by swimming
the quadrat at a slow, regulated speed in 10-m long sections
to cover the entire 100 m 2 area.
Data Analysis
Because there was nonnormal distribution of some com-
ponents of the data set, a series of nonparametric Wilcoxon
signed-rank tests were performed to compare differences
between onshore and aquatic variables at high angling- and
low angling-activity sites (Zar 1999). Fish diversity was
assessed using the Shannon Wiener Index (H’), and dif-
ferences were compared using Wilcoxon signed-rank test
(Zar 1999). All analyses were conducted using the statis-
tical software program JMP v. 7.0 (SAS Institute, Raleigh,
NC), and results were assessed for significance at
a = 0.05. Because there were multiple comparisons, we
applied Bonferroni corrections to all variables, and both
corrected and uncorrected alpha values are presented (see
Tables 1 through 4). All values are presented as
means ± SEs unless otherwise noted.
Results
Aquatic Variables
Water-quality metrics (i.e., dissolved oxygen, turbidity,
water temperature) were generally similar between high
angling- and low angling-activity sites at 0, 5, and 10 m
from shore (Table 1). Low angling-activity sites were
characterized by increased numbers of aquatic macrophyte
species, higher macrophyte densities (% cover), and greater
macrophyte height (cm) directly along the shoreline (0 m
from shore) compared with high angling-activity sites
(number of species: W = -18.0, P = 0.008; density:
W = -21.0, P = 0.012; height: W = -20.50, P = 0.012;
Table 1). We did not detect differences in aquatic macro-
phyte diversity, density, or height between high angling-
and low angling-activity sites at 5 and 10 m from shore
(Table 1).
Terrestrial Variables
Differences between high angling- and low angling-activ-
ity sites were noted in all terrestrial variables measured
within both the 6-m 2 and 0.25-m 2 quadrats (Table 2). The
percentage of barren area was much higher in the high
angling-activity sites compared with low angling-activity
sites (0.25-m 2 quadrat: W = 45.5, P = 0.0002; 6-m 2
quadrat: W = 45.5, P = 0.0002). High angling-activity
sites had nearly 100% barren area in the 0.25-m 2 quadrat
areas (Fig. 1a), and 6-m 2 quadrats in the high angling-
activity areas had nearly four times the amount of barren
area as the low angling-activity sites (Table 2). Plant
height (mm) was higher in both the 0.25-m 2 and the 6-m 2
quadrats at low angling-activity sites (0.25-m 2 quadrat:
W = -44.0, P = 0.0007; 6-m 2 quadrat: W = -44.5,
P = 0.0005; Table 2 and Fig. 1b). Low angling-activity
sites typically contained more plant species (W = -45.5,
P = 0.0002) within the 0.25-m 2 quadrats than did paired
high angling-activity sites (Table 2 and Fig. 2a). Low
angling-activity sites also had a higher percentage of nat-
ural shoreline vegetation compared with high angling-
activity sites (W = -39.0, P = 0.0005; Table 2 and
Fig. 2b). Last, soil compaction was greater in high angling-
than in low angling-activity sites as evidenced by differ-
ences in soil bulk density (W = 15.0, P = 0.0391; Table 2
and Fig. 2c).
Litter
The number of pieces of angling-related litter as well as the
number of pieces of non-angling-specific litter was much
higher at high angling-activity sites (angling-related litter:
W = 44.5, P = 0.0005; non-angling-related litter: W = 45.5,
Environmental Management (2009) 44:324–334 327
123
P = 0.0002; Table 3 and Fig. 3a). Correspondingly, weight
(g) of both angling-related and non-angling-related litter
was also higher at high angling-activity sites (weight of
angling-related litter: W = 47.5, P = 0.0012; weight of
non-angling-related litter: W = 47.5, P = 0.0012; Table 3
and Fig. 3b). More discarded fishing line was found at high
angling-activity sites. Indeed, the length of line was
900 times longer at high angling- than low angling-activity
sites (W = 45.5, P = 0.0002). The average length of fish-
ing line segments found at the 14 high angling-activity sites
was 906 ± 335 cm, and a total of 127 m of fishing line was
found across all 14 locations. This compares with the

complete lack of fishing line found at any of the low
angling-activity sites. The average number lead pieces
found at high angling-activity sites was 0.86 ± 0.39 pieces,
and the average weight of lead pieces collected at high
angling-activity sites was 3.5 ± 1.85 g. We did not find any
lead fishing gear at low angling-activity sites.
Fish Species Metrics
The most common fish species we encountered at each of
the sites were mainly members of the centrarchid family
(smallmouth bass, bluegill, and pumpkinseed), brown
bullhead (Ameirurus nebulosus), yellow perch (Perca
flavescens), and various cyprinids. Fish species richness
and abundance were not different between sites of high and
low angling activity (Table 4).
Discussion
Many urbanized regions offer opportunities for recreational
fishing, with convenient access to shoreline angling sites
suitable for anglers of varying age and experience (Sch-
ramm and Edwards 1994). Our selection of sampling sites
was based on several criteria, including evidence of tram-
pling, soil compaction, decreased vegetation cover, and,
most importantly, presence of angling-related waste. In
addition, a conservation officer (who visits areas of high-
angling intensity frequently to optimize enforcement and
outreach efforts) and local anglers (involved in the lead-
ership of local angling clubs) were consulted before the
study, and their recommendations were used to select the
locations of the study sites. However, our low angling-
activity sites were always chosen randomly (25 m either
upstream or downstream from high-angling sites) and
served as relevant controls. It is important to note that
although some sites also displayed evidence of other rec-
reational use (canoe launching, dog walking), fishing
activity was always apparent. We recognized that we were
intentionally selecting high angling-activity sites and then
identified the exact locations where we believed anglers
stood to fish. Indeed, we often saw anglers at these sites
before, during, or after the study. Conversely, we never
saw anglers at the low angling-activity sites. As such, we
believe that our site selection and sampling procedures
were valid.
The percentage of barren area in high angling-activity
sites was considerably greater than at low angling-activity
sites, which was likely caused by the increased foot traffic
into angling access points. Increased foot traffic typically
restricts plant growth (Cole 1987; Sun and Walsh 1998),
decreases plant diversity (Ros and others 2004) and aver-
age plant height, and leads to increased soil compaction
(Manning 1979; Marion and Cole 1996; Andre´s-Abella´n
and others 2005). In turn, decreased plant growth was
correlated with decreased percentage of natural shoreline at
sites of high angling activity (Table 2). Human disturbance
caused by foot traffic was shown to affect soil compaction

in a number of studies (Marion and Cole 1996; Andre´s-
Abella´n and others 2005; Amrein and others 2005). And-
re´s-Abella´n and others (2005) found that soil bulk density
ranged from 1.43 to 1.48 g/cm 3 and that barren area was on
average 61% in campsites with high levels of foot traffic.
These values are similar to our findings that average bulk
density values were 1.42 g/cm 3 at high angling-activity
sites. Other studies have also shown that species richness
and density of ground vegetation is decreased in areas that
experience high recreational use (Marion and Cole 1996;
Ros and others 2004; Amrein and others 2005).
Aquatic macrophyte diversity, density, and height were
greater at low angling-activity sites, but only in the areas
near the shore. It is unclear whether anglers were the direct
reason for the decrease in aquatic macrophyte abundance
and size at high angling-activity sites or if anglers con-
sciously choose these sites because of the lack of macro-
phytes at that location. Slipke and others (1998) performed
a creel survey in which they found that angler preference
for abundance of aquatic macrophytes was dependent on
the fish species targeted. Anglers targeting largemouth bass
preferred a greater abundance of aquatic macrophytes, and
anglers targeting other species preferred less macrophyte
coverage at their fishing sites (Slipke and others 1998). In
addition, anglers may be actively removing aquatic mac-
rophytes while fishing (e.g., by unintentionally snagging
macrophytes) because desiccated aquatic macrophytes
were often observed at angling sites where they had been
removed from fishing gear and discarded onshore. A
decrease in macrophyte growth and diversity in nearshore
high angling-activity sites may also be attributed to anglers
wading into the water from the bank and trampling aquatic
vegetation.
Water quality did not vary between high angling- and
low angling-activity sites (Table 1). One would expect that
water quality would be degraded in areas exposed to high
angling activity because other variables in these areas

indicated ecologic disturbance (e.g., presence of litter,
decreased plant cover, soil compaction). Water temperature
may be affected by the extent of riparian vegetation,
channel geometry, and aquatic macrophytes (LeBlanc and
others 1996; King and Warburton 2007). It could be rea-
sonable to expect that decreased shoreline vegetation as
well as decreased aquatic macrophyte growth in high
angling-activity areas would lead to locally increased water
temperatures and therefore lower dissolved oxygen levels,
especially in areas of slow-moving water. In nearshore
areas of high angling activity, aquatic macrophyte growth
was less than in nearshore areas of low angling activity.
Because the presence of aquatic macrophytes is also
associated with increased water clarity (Scheffer 1999), it
could be expected that turbidity would be greater at high
angling-activity sites. However, the similarities in water-
quality metrics between high angling- and low angling-
activity sites may simply be related to the majority of the
sites being located on riverine systems (albeit with
reasonably low velocities) and because paired sites were
only separated by 25 m. Nonetheless, we focused on
microscale differences, including areas right at the water–
land interface, where we anticipated that effects would be
detectable if they were present. In general, onshore areas
seemed to experience greater disturbance from shoreline-
angling activities than in-water zones. Metrics such as
turbidity might be expected to vary more so between sites
during or after rainfall when precipitation would mobilize
silt in areas where there is decreased vegetation, particu-
larly given that the soil was compacted so water infiltration
would be decreased (Luke and others 2007).
Overall, the amount of both angling- and non-angling-
related litter was greater at high angling-activity sites. The
presence of litter was apparent at each site that we visited
because it was one of the defining criteria for our site
selection. Although the most dominant type of angling-
related litter was monofilament fishing line, discarded
fishing gear packaging (e.g., worm containers, lure

packaging) made up 12% of the total number of pieces of
discarded angling related litter. Several local tackle shops
in Ottawa provide a refund for returning used Styrofoam
worm containers in an effort to decrease littering; however,
clearly more education is needed. To mitigate these issues,
there may also be merit in selling tackle in bulk form
without packaging as an additional means of decreasing
litter potential. We found an average of 905 cm monofil-
ament line at high angling-activity sites. Not only is dis-
carded fishing line aesthetically unpleasing, it also has the
potential to harm wildlife. Franson and others (2003) found
that 235 individuals of 8 species of waterbirds sampled
(both live birds and carcasses) across 25 states during
5 years had fishing line entangled around their bodies, were
embedded with hooks, or had ingested nonlead fishing
litter. Presence of these materials was most apparent in
waterbird species with large samples sizes ([50) of brown
pelicans (Pelecanus occidentalis), double-crested cormo-
rants (Phalacrocorax auritus), and common loons (Gavia
immer). Cryer and others (1987) estimated that B13.7 m of
fishing line was lost per angler, and Forbes (1986) found
that the average length of line discarded around a small,
coarse fishery lake to be 56 cm. Lead deposition can also
pose a hazard to wildlife, especially to birds that ingest
small stones and grit to aid digestion (Scheuhammer and
others 2003). Lead poisoning in birds may result in lethal
and sublethal effects, including decreased body weight,
reproductive stress, and anemia (Scheuhammer and Norris
1995; Kendall and others 1996). Franson and others (2003)
also found that 3.5% of common loons and 2.7% of brown
pelicans had ingested lead fishing weights. Although we
did not find a difference in lead fishing tackle between our
high angling- and low angling-activity sites, lead pieces
were found at most of the high angling-activity sites. The
amount of lead found during our study was considerably
less compared with previous European studies in high
angling-activity areas, such as that by Cryer and others
(1987), who reported up to 298 lead sinkers/m 2
, and by
Forbes (1986), who found the average and total weight of
lead pieces to be 0.81 g and 33.5 kg, respectively.
Our results also showed a lack of difference in fish
community metrics (species richness and abundance)
between high angling- and low angling-activity sites. We
also did not find a difference between the distances to cover
between high angling- and low angling-activity sites.
Foraging activities and predator avoidance are influenced
by habitat complexity (Snickars and others 2004; Stuart-
Smith and others 2007). Troutman and others (2007) found
that aquatic macrophyte complexity was associated with
greater fish diversity and density. We had expected to see
decreases in fish community structure in high angling-
activity areas as a result of decreased aquatic macrophyte
growth and riparian cover (Tables 1, 2). We also predicted
that poor water quality would have an impact on fish
community health. High turbidity can obstruct gills and
interfere with predator–prey interactions (Miner and Stein
1996; Sutherland and Meyer 2008), whereas low levels of
dissolved oxygen and sudden temperature changes can
degrade physiologic condition as well as influence behav-
iour and habitat selection (Fry 1971; Kramer 1987).
Because we did not see a change in water quality and
aquatic macrophyte growth in areas farther than 1 m from
shore, it is not surprising that the fish community was
similar between high angling- and low angling-activity
sites.
Management and Conservation Implications
To mitigate the potential deleterious effects of shoreline
angling, regulators must adopt a comprehensive approach
that seeks to change angler attitudes and behaviour as well
as encourage compliance with local regulations. There may
also be a need to revise existing regulations or enact new
policy to regulate angling effort. Angler education and
outreach are key components to decreasing many delete-
rious effects on the environment because changes in angler
behaviour, especially with regard to discarded fishing
equipment or other litter, are relatively straightforward
solutions. Publication of educational material directed at
anglers of all ages and experience levels must be made
easily available. Information in this material should outline
the potential for ecologic degradation because of shoreline
angling as well as potential steps to mitigate the effects of a
single individual. Similarly, regulators should encourage
responsible angling behaviour through a few simple steps.
Although the majority of the sites sampled were within
close proximity to parks and recreational areas (walking
and bicycle paths, parking lots), trash bins were not always
within close range. A simple recommendation for litter
reduction would be for the placement of bins at popular
shoreline angling locations along with posted notices
reminding users of the potentially harmful effects of dis-
carding angling and non-angling waste. In addition, efforts
to decrease packaging associated with fishing gear or
providing incentives (e.g., deposits on Styrofoam worm
containers) to return or recycle angling-related packaging
would be worthwhile. It is important to note that there is
also a trade-off between the broad-ranging social benefits
of shoreline fishing and some of the ecologic impacts
incurred by angling. Shoreline angling, especially in urban
areas, provides people with a link to green space and a
connection with the natural environment, valuable relaxa-
tion time, and time spent with friends and families that may
be otherwise impossible in highly developed areas (Fedler
and Ditton 1994; Schramm and others 2003). As such, it
must be recognized that there is intrinsic value in activities
332 Environmental Management (2009) 44:324–334
123
so that shoreline angling must be preserved while mini-
mizing potential environmental impacts.
Mitigating environmental impacts may take the form of
actions such as either formalizing high angling-activity
areas (and perhaps build engineered structures such as
docks or fishing platforms) or restricting angling activity
along natural shorelines that are still relatively undisturbed.
By protecting low-use areas, fish communities will likely
benefit because the same species and abundance are found
at high angling-activity sites where they are subject to
greater fishing pressure. If a restorative approach is taken,
the timescale for ecologic recovery for most high angling-
activity sites is unknown. Further assessments must be
completed before these areas can be effectively re-estab-
lished. Furthermore, there is insufficient information on the
ecologic and environmental consequences of shoreline
angling to optimize effectively the management of angling
effort to maintain ecologic integrity of riparian and aquatic
ecosystems. Further research could include experimental
designs involving the use of time-lapse cameras to evaluate
actual user intensities at high-activity sites (i.e., angler use
vs. other recreational activities, such as canoe launching or
dog walking). The work presented here is intended to
contribute to the deficiency in knowledge of ecologic and
environmental effects of shoreline angling. We hoped that
it will stimulate more research on this topic.
